# Advent of Code 2022 using Go

## Project Structure
Project is attempting to keep the simplest layout possible. Each day can be run
independently 

## Automation
Very little is automated, however you can automatically create a new day folder
and download the input for that day using the Makefile from the root of the project
where ? is the day number.

`make new year=2022 day=?`
