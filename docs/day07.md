# Day 7
Since I have started to have less time, I have focused more on first solving the solutions and less time on making clean or tested code when I can avoid it. Here it was more helpful to pretty print the state of our filesystem than to have overly complicated tests when first debugging. So I spent most of the initial extra effort time on implementing the pretty printing, including tree indentation and coloring. Eventually this day would be a great fit for creating complicated and very stateful tests, just not for fun for now. :)

For day 7 there wasn't any terribly complicated algorithms used yet. Most of the focus is on parsing the commands and building up the directory structure as a tree data structure. For getting directory sizes, it is just a depth first traversal to bubble up sizes from a nodes children. I think this can be optimized by moving it to an array based tree since it seems like the constant allocations are taking up a majority of the time. Array based may also improve some cpu caching with nodes allocating together in memory. I hope to revisit today to do some pprof analysis to see where the bottlenecks are.

For the second part it was again traversing the entire tree to find the minimum value over the required threshold. I haven't though of optimizing this part yet. First and simplest solution that jumps to mind is to just to modify calculate size to do this calculation as it goes instead of traversing twice.
