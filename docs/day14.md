# Day 14
Nothing crazy worth noting today, just the same basics. Keep things basic, avoid unnecessary allocations. Avoid creating
unneeded objects.

I did create a PointScanner that behaves like some of the bufio scanners which was pretty cool! It was a cool pattern
to emulate and I was still able to keep it very clean and performant without extra overhead.
